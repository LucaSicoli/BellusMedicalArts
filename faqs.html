                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Botox is a botulinum toxin which is a protein that was first discovered when it was produced by bacteria that grew in food that was not well preserved. Since then, it has been purified and has a wide range of use in the medical field. The dose used in cosmetic procedures is minute and has no effect on the rest of the body. Botulinum toxins like Botox has been used successfully in non-surgical procedures for many years. It smooths away any wrinkles created by movement, especially on your forehead, around your eyes and other areas of the face</p>

                        <p>Botox and other neurotoxins in its class block certain chemical signals from nerves that cause muscles to contract. The most common use of these injections is to relax or restrict the movement of you facial muscles that cause frown lines and other facial wrinkle to appear in the first place. Botox can help restrict the movement of your facial muscles to make lines and wrinkles, such as the crow’s feet and frown lines, appear less obvious.</p>

                        <p>The botulinum toxin is then injected into the muscles in your face, where your lines appear. It is a very quick procedure and should take around 10 or 15 minutes. An anaesthetic or a numbing medication is not essential as the procedure is quite painless, however, a topical anaesthetic can be applied if requested. </p>

                        <p>One common concern among Botox users is that stopping treatments will lead to more severe wrinkles or a deflated appearance. However, this is absolutely not the case.

                        <p>Binding of the neurotoxin to a nerve can take anywhere from 1-3 weeks depending on how fast your body breaks down Botox after injection.
